This project was an exercise in using separate JS modules and webpack to create
a finished restaurant website. Webpack seemed a bit unpleasant to learn as a 
newer developer with its somewhat steep learning curve and voluminous 
syntax-heavy settings. This adds a layer of complexity. 

However, once webpack was setup properly, working in separate modules did seem 
cleaner and more organized. For this page it probably doesn't matter, but for a
much larger project or complex web app, I could see how this type of work flow
could become very important.
